# Authorization

To talk to us, you need some Authorization. Simply head to [API key](https://memerator.me/api/auth) to get you set up! It's crucial to not tell anyone this! It's secure, for you, and with it, anyone can use your account. **All requests require authorization.**

Once you have a key, you simply need to add an Authorization header to your requests.

`Authorization: [your key]`
